# Stock-Valuation
This algorithm applies different financial models to calculate the reasonable price of a single stock in order to provide a better way of investing in a stock.

# Objective
The purpose of writing this alogrithm is to calculate reasonable price for stocks in order to determine a buy signal when underpriced and a sell signal when overpriced.

# Valuation Model
Different financial valuation model including Price-To-Earning ratio, Price-To-Sales ratio and Price-to-fund-from-operations ratio. The reasonable price is calculated as follow:
reasonable price = 5 year averaged ratio * trailing 12 months per share value


# Visualisation
The graph below shows a REITS called ESS. After research, Price-to-fund-from-operations seem to be the best method of valuing a reits since it takes into consideration the growth of its underlying assets.
